# Nasa-Meteorite-Landings-Data-Exploration  

Data was taken from: https://github.com/c-blomquist/Nasa-Meteorite-Landings-Data-Exploration.git  
However, it was pulled from the June 3, 2023 version with the wayback machine as data.nasa.gov was down when attempting to obtain the data. 

This is serving as a personal interest project as I love outer space, and I want to expand my technical skills as I graduate college soon.
